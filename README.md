This application was built to be a personal expense helper, to organize your finances and be reminded about the due dates of your bills. Although many services do the same thing, the purpose here is to anyone control their data, not sharing with 3rd party companies that probably will sell your information with profit objectives.
The name of this project is inspired by Mansa Musa figure, that was a Mali king known for his inestimable gold amount, that lived between 1280-1337.
## Features

* Register recurrent or one time expenses
